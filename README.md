# What is Firebase Cloud Messaging Service
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.
Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to 4000 bytes to a client app.
attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has itâ€™s *FCM server key exposed* 
and send notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!
